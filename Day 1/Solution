### üöÄ Day 1 of the Bash Scripting Challenge! üöÄ

Today, we kicked off our journey into bash scripting, and here‚Äôs a recap of what we covered with some practical examples:

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Comments:**

We learned how to add comments to our scripts for clarity.

Example:

```bash
# This line is a comment and explains the next line of code
echo "Hello, World!"  # This will print a greeting to the terminal

```

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Echo Command:**

The `echo` command helps us display messages on the terminal.

Example:

```bash
echo "Welcome to the Bash Scripting Challenge!"

```

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Variables:**

We discovered how to declare and assign values to variables.

Example:

```bash
a=5
b=10

```

**4Ô∏è‚É£ Using Variables for Math:**

We created a script to take two numbers and calculate their sum.

Example:

```bash
sum=$((a + b))
echo "The sum of $a and $b is: $sum"

```

**5Ô∏è‚É£ Built-in Variables:**

We explored built-in variables to access useful information.

Example:

```bash
echo "Current Directory: $PWD"
echo "Home Directory: $HOME"

```

**6Ô∏è‚É£ Wildcards:**

We learned to use wildcards to list files with a specific extension.

Example:

```bash
ls *.txt  # Lists all .txt files in the current directory

```
